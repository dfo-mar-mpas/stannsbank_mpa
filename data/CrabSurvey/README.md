The data in this 2023 folder is for the 2024 SAB CSAS data review. 
SABMPA_SCsurvey_Dec2023export.csv is from Amy Glass and contains all catch data for all SAB stations (enhanced and not) from 2015 to 2023. 
There is no real data from 2020 due to covid. The 2019 survey did extend into January 2020, so change the "2020" year to 2019. 

The RData object has RData from the catch and fish measurement data, as well as some shapefiles and coordinates. This is just basic data that has been manipulated to be more usable.
